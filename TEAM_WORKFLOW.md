# Area Project CI/CD Workflow

## ðŸš€ Team Development Process

### Overview
This project uses a **staging â†’ production CI/CD workflow** to ensure code quality and safe deployments.

```
Team Members â†’ Personal Repo (Staging/CI) â†’ Organization Repo (Production)
```

### ðŸ“‹ Workflow Steps

1. **Team Development**: All team members work on features/fixes
2. **Pull Request to Personal Repo**: Submit PR to `EthanBranchereau/area-cicd-mirror`
3. **Automated CI/Testing**: CircleCI runs full test suite on personal repo
4. **Manual Review**: Code review and approval
5. **Merge to Staging**: Changes merged to personal repo `main` branch
6. **Staging Deployment**: Automatic deployment to staging server for verification
7. **Production Promotion**: If staging tests pass, automatically:
   - Push changes to organization repo (`EpitechPGE3-2025/G-DEV-500-MPL-5-1-area-2`)
   - Deploy to production server
   - Restart production services

### ðŸ‘¥ For Team Members

#### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the personal staging repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EthanBranchereau/area-cicd-mirror.git
   cd area-cicd-mirror
   ```

2. **Add personal repo as upstream**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/EthanBranchereau/area-cicd-mirror.git
   ```

3. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Develop your feature**:
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Submit Pull Request**:
   - Go to `https://github.com/EthanBranchereau/area-cicd-mirror`
   - Create PR from your fork to the main branch
   - Add descriptive title and description
   - Request review

3. **After PR Approval**:
   - PR will be merged to `main`
   - CircleCI automatically triggers staging deployment
   - If staging tests pass, production deployment begins
   - Monitor pipeline at: https://circleci.com/gh/EthanBranchereau/area-cicd-mirror

### ðŸ”§ For Repository Admin (Ethan)

#### Required Environment Variables in CircleCI

Add these in CircleCI Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=<personal_access_token_with_repo_scope>
SSH_HOST=144.24.201.112
SSH_USERNAME=ethanl
DB_PASSWORD=<your_production_db_password>
```

#### GitHub Token Setup

1. Go to GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Add as `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable in CircleCI

### ðŸ“Š Monitoring and Troubleshooting

#### Pipeline Status
- **Staging CI**: https://circleci.com/gh/EthanBranchereau/area-cicd-mirror
- **Production Status**: Check server at http://144.24.201.112/health

#### Pipeline Stages
1. **Backend CI**: PHP tests, Laravel setup
2. **Frontend CI**: Node build, ESLint, React tests  
3. **Staging Deploy**: Deploy to staging server for testing
4. **Production Deploy**: Push to org repo + production deployment

#### Troubleshooting
- **Failed Tests**: Check CircleCI logs for specific test failures
- **Deployment Issues**: SSH into server and check logs:
  ```bash
  ssh ethanl@144.24.201.112
  sudo systemctl status nginx
  sudo systemctl status php8.2-fpm
  tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
  ```

### ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- SSH keys are managed by CircleCI
- Production deployments are automated and audited

### ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of This Workflow

âœ… **Quality Assurance**: All code tested before production
âœ… **Safe Deployments**: Staging environment catches issues
âœ… **Automated Process**: Minimal manual intervention
âœ… **Audit Trail**: Complete history of deployments
âœ… **Team Collaboration**: Standard PR process
âœ… **Production Stability**: Validated changes only
