## Production Deployment & Process Management

### Running Laravel Backend as a Service
For production, use **Supervisor** to keep the backend running:

1. Install Supervisor:
	```bash
	sudo apt-get install supervisor
	```
2. Create `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/laravel-backend.conf`:
	```ini
	[program:laravel-backend]
	directory=/home/deploy/area-app/backend
	command=php artisan serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=8000
	autostart=true
	autorestart=true
	user=deploy
	stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/laravel-backend.log
	stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/laravel-backend-error.log
	```
3. Reload and start:
	```bash
	sudo supervisorctl reread
	sudo supervisorctl update
	sudo supervisorctl start laravel-backend
	```
4. Check status:
	```bash
	sudo supervisorctl status
	```

### Troubleshooting
- After running migrations or reseeding, restart the backend:
  ```bash
  sudo supervisorctl restart laravel-backend
  ```
- Check logs:
  ```bash
  tail -f /var/log/supervisor/laravel-backend.log
  tail -f /var/log/supervisor/laravel-backend-error.log
  ```

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
